## Description
Celestia EA is a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor (EA) is designed to automate trading operations in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses a combination of technical indicators and predefined trading rules to identify potential entry and exit points in the forex market.

## Features
- Risk management: The EA allows you to specify the risk percentage per trade, ensuring that your risk exposure is controlled.
- Stop loss and take profit levels: You can set the desired stop loss and take profit levels for each trade.
- Trailing stop: The EA offers a trailing stop feature to protect profits and maximize gains.
- Entry and exit signals: The EA checks for entry and exit signals based on its internal logic and predefined rules.

## How It Works
The Celestia EA follows a simple trading algorithm. It constantly monitors the market for potential entry signals. Once an entry signal is detected, the EA calculates the position size based on the specified risk percentage. It then opens a market order with the calculated position size.

After opening a trade, the EA sets the stop loss and take profit levels according to the user-defined parameters. It also activates the trailing stop feature to trail the stop loss level as the trade progresses.

The EA continuously checks for exit signals. When an exit signal is identified, it closes all open positions.

Please note that this code is a sample representation and may not include the actual entry and exit signal logic. To access the official version of this product and its complete features, visit the developer's site.
